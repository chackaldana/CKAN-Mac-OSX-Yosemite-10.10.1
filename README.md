How to install CKAN in Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.1

If you want to install the CKAN project ckan.org in a MAC OS X Yosemite 10.10 you will see a lot of problems in dependencies, so
this file CKAN has the lines to install the project.

The only requirement is to install brew.

http://brew.sh

Which has ruby!

CKAN it´s a great open data project and in case you trie WordPress, Joomla, o whatever CMS, you´ll be familiar in his use.

The potential of connect HDFS for the DATASTORE and store DATASETS in Organizations becames the value of this solution.

In this forum will be developing more code for phases of:

1.- Connect HDFS Enterprise Storage like Isilon
2.- Change Jetty to TC Server Spring
3.- Use of Cloud Foundry for Mobile Apps in uses cases
4.- Use of HPIG for news Searches
